### Retraining Scheduler

This scheduler was made for the technical assignment for NewGlobe

### How it works
Simply put the topics in input.txt (or a file of your choosing, this can be configured in appsettings.json) and run the program.

The program should put these topics into several tracks until all of them are scheduled.
